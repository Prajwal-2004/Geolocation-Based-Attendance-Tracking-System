# GeoAttend — Geolocation-Based Attendance Tracking System

A mobile-first attendance tracking application that uses real-time GPS coordinates, polygon-based geofencing, and **OTP-based identity verification** to prevent proxy attendance. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

---

## 📱 Features

- **Role-based authentication** (Student, Faculty, Admin)
- **GPS-based check-in/check-out** with real-time location capture
- **4-corner polygon geofencing** — admin defines classroom boundaries using 4 coordinate points
- **Haversine formula** for distance calculation and reporting
- **OTP identity verification** — 6-digit code sent to registered phone number after geofence validation
- **Phone number registration** — required for OTP verification
- **Course & Semester selection** — students and faculty choose from 10 engineering branches and semesters 1–8
- **Class Teacher system** — faculty can be designated as class teacher for a specific semester+course, gaining access to all students' attendance across every subject
- **Teacher assignment per geofence** — admin assigns a teacher and their subject to each zone
- **Teacher Dashboard** — faculty view their assigned classes, attendance stats, and (if class teacher) a full cross-subject view of their class students
- **Anti-spoofing measures** — timestamp consistency checks, GPS accuracy validation
- **Admin dashboard** — geofence configuration, attendance records, anomaly reports, user management
- **5-minute check-in buffer** — students must check in within 5 minutes of class start time
- **Duplicate prevention** — prevents multiple active check-ins
- **Anomaly logging** — flags suspicious activity for admin review
- **Lovable Cloud backend** — database, authentication, edge functions

## 🔐 Identity Verification System

### How It Works

When a student is **inside the geofence** and clicks "Check In", a **verification popup** appears:

#### OTP via SMS
- Sends a **6-digit one-time password** to the student's registered phone number
- Phone number is **required during registration** and verified via OTP at signup
- *Currently in demo mode* — OTP is logged to browser console (production would use an SMS provider via Lovable Cloud edge functions)

## 🎓 Class Teacher Feature

Faculty members can optionally be designated as a **Class Teacher** during registration:

- **Not a class teacher (NA)**: They only see attendance for their own assigned geofence zones (subject-specific)
- **Class teacher of Sem X, Course Y**: They get an additional **"My Class"** tab showing:
  - All students enrolled in that semester + course
  - Every attendance record for those students across **all subjects and teachers**
  - Per-student breakdown with recent check-in history

This enables class teachers to monitor overall student engagement, not just their own subject.

## 🗂️ File Structure & Explanation

### Core Application Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/main.tsx` | Entry point. Mounts the React app to the DOM. |
| `src/App.tsx` | Root component. Defines routes, wraps app with AuthProvider, QueryClient, and UI providers. Contains `ProtectedRoute` and `AuthRoute` logic for role-based access control. |
| `index.html` | HTML shell with mobile-optimized viewport meta tags and PWA-ready attributes. |

### Types

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/types/index.ts` | TypeScript type definitions for `User` (with `phoneNumber`, `course`, `semester`, `classTeacherOf`), `Geofence` (with `PolygonPoint[]` corners, teacher assignment), `AttendanceRecord`, `LocationData`, and `AnomalyLog`. Also exports `ENGINEERING_COURSES` and `SEMESTERS` constants. |

### Core Logic (Business Logic Layer)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/storage.ts` | **Data Persistence Module** — CRUD operations for users, geofences, attendance records, and anomalies via localStorage. Handles registration with phone number, course, and semester fields. |
| `src/lib/geofence.ts` | **Location & Geofence Validation Module** — Haversine formula, polygon centroid calculation, `validateLocation()`, `validateTimestamp()` and `checkGpsAccuracy()` for anti-spoofing, and `getCurrentLocation()` with watchPosition. |

### Authentication

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` | React context providing `login()`, `register()`, `logout()`, and current `user` state. Seeds default admin on mount. |

### Components

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/VerificationDialog.tsx` | **Identity Verification Popup** — Appears after geofence validation passes. Sends OTP to student's registered phone and verifies the code before completing check-in. |

### Pages (UI Layer)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/pages/Login.tsx` | Login screen with email/password form, demo admin credentials. |
| `src/pages/Register.tsx` | Registration with role selection (Student/Faculty), **course & semester dropdowns** (10 engineering branches, semesters 1–8), student ID, phone number, subject (faculty), and **class teacher assignment** (faculty). |
| `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` | Student/Faculty dashboard. Full check-in flow: location capture → anti-spoofing → geofence validation → **OTP verification** → attendance record. Class dropdown shows teacher name and subject. |
| `src/pages/TeacherDashboard.tsx` | Faculty dashboard: assigned classes stats, attendance records, and **class teacher tab** (cross-subject student attendance view). |
| `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` | Admin dashboard: geofence management with teacher/subject assignment, attendance records, anomaly reports, user list. |
| `src/pages/NotFound.tsx` | 404 fallback page. |

### Design System

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.css` | CSS design tokens with HSL color variables, custom scrollbar, font imports (Inter + JetBrains Mono). |
| `tailwind.config.ts` | Tailwind configuration with semantic color tokens, animations, and border radius tokens. |

## 🧮 Algorithms & Security

### Haversine Formula (Distance Calculation)

Calculates the great-circle distance between two points on Earth:
```
a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1) · cos(lat2) · sin²(Δlon/2)
c = 2 · atan2(√a, √(1−a))
d = R · c    (R = 6,371,000m)
```

### Anti-Spoofing Checks

| Check | Description | Threshold |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Timestamp Consistency | Rejects if client timestamp drifts from device time | >30 seconds |
| GPS Accuracy | Flags suspiciously perfect accuracy (mock GPS tools) | ≤1 meter |

### 5-Minute Check-In Buffer

- Admin sets a **class start time** per geofence zone
- Students must check in between the start time and **5 minutes after**
- Early or late check-ins are automatically rejected with a descriptive message
